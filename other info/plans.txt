Before this we extract the seed from tourney_seeds and region from the seed. This was my first approach. Now this time I will try different. I will use the regular season data,tournament results data from 1998 to 2013 and regular season data of 2014 and seeds of the 2014 to predict the probabilities for 2014 tournament results. For 2015 we will use the data till 2014 and so on...
